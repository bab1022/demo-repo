This is for class. That's the description.


A three to five sentence bio about me. I like to play music on instruments such as the synthesizer and guitar. I also like amateur radio. I have also raced a real race car (a Ferrari 488 GT EVO). Finally, I have a project car. These are the things I like to do. Academically, I hope to move on to a master's degree after I complete my undergrad.
